{-| Fold over each shape in the world. Use this to convert shapes into visual representation, e.g. WebGL entities.

        world

  - `transform` is a transformation matrix that offsets and rotates a shape into the world coorditantes

  - `bodyId` is an id of a body the shape belongs to, each new body in the world gets and id starting from 0

  - `shapeId` is an id of the shape, each new shape in a body gets and id starting from 0

Use `bodyId` and `shapeId` to link additional information from the outside of the engine, e.g. which mesh to render
or what color should this shape be.
